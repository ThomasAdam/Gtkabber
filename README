Gtkabber
========

This is a very crude GTK-replacement for tabbed [1].

Still very much in development.

Patches welcome, see the TODO file.

Dependencies
============

* GTK 3.X.
* Libunique 3.X [2]
* GLib

Operation
=========

The protocol-handling of Gtkabber sucks.  It's a huge hack.  For the
time-being, this has to happen:

% gtkabber &
% gtkabber next-socket
1213313
% xterm -into 1213313
% gtkabber next-socket
20987
% vimprobable2 -e 20987

It should be able to capture the output of "gtkabber new-socket" though more
dynamically.

The problem is that each new tab has to have a new socket to embed (or
"plug" to use the crap terminology of GTK) -- in theory, I could use the
same socket many times if I was prepared to wrap that around a UNIX domain
socket and reparent the window being sent through it, but I can't be
bothered.

This approach sucks for now, but I'll try and clean it up.
