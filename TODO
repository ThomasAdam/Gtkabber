In no particular order:

1.  Hook into PropertyNotify event of child widgets (GtkSocket) and listen
    for title change to reflect tab title.
2.  Config file.
3.  Memory management.
4.  Key/mouse binding support.
5.  Cleanups to existing functions.
6.  Try and get GtkPlug patch included upstream!
7.  Documentation!
8.  Autotools (?)
9.  Socket handling and exposing to the user in a more user-friendly way.
